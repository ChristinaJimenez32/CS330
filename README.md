How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first understanding requirements. I want to make sure that I have the skill set or am comfortable with the skills needed to execute the project. I then devise a plan to work on prroject in parts. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I learned various design skills, I had no prior experience designing prior to the claaa. The use of lighting and textures, rendering and transforming objects have help me have a basic understanding of visuals. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a very basic design process, I first did research about skills I would need to learn, then defined the problem, the modules assignments were essentially prototypes, then I would implement my learned skill to the final project, test and make changes accordingly. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think the design process itself is effecient. I worked on the project throughput the semester and would add features and test as I went.
How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by first defining the needs, what is expected.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I really focused on iteration,this is the first class I would receive feedback every week and adjust my project to cater to the feedback received.
How did iteration factor into your development?
As mentioned, iteration played a big role. As I received feedback I would change my design.As I learned new skills I would change my scene to compliment the new skills. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I think I focused more on iteration and testing, At first the tasks were easy, however, as I progressed I realized how objects were reliant on one another to make the scene together.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will help me reach my goals since I learn how to problem solve and use design processes to reach final goals.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Although my interest are not particularly in graphics, I think having the skill set can be of a benefit, I can enhance applications if needed with the basic skills I have acquired. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I think the skillsets are valuable, but the problem solving and the parts of the design process I utilized benefitted me as well, I was able to receive feedback and implement changes based on feedback. This to me is a valuable skill.
